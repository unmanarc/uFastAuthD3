## Key Features  

- **JWT Authentication**: Supports stateless JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure, token-based authentication.  
- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular design allows seamless integration with distributed systems.  
- **Local Database**: Stores user credentials and session data locally, reducing external dependencies.  
- **Secure Authentication**: Passwords are hashed and sessions are encrypted.  
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Optional 2FA via TOTP for heightened security.  
- **Multi-Application Support**: Manage multiple applications and user roles within a single instance.  
- **Ultra-Low Footprint**: Optimized for minimal resource usage (RAM, CPU, storage).  
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and even **Raspberry Pi**.
